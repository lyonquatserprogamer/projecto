            <h2>What is Valorant?</h2>
            <p>Valorant is a free-to-play tactical first-person shooter developed and published by Riot Games. The game combines precise gunplay with unique agent abilities, creating a dynamic and strategic gameplay experience. Released in June 2020, it has quickly become one of the most popular games in the competitive FPS genre.</p>
            <p>Each match in Valorant is a 5v5 battle where one team attacks while the other defends. The attackers aim to plant a bomb-like device called the Spike, while defenders work to prevent this or defuse it. The game emphasizes teamwork, communication, and strategic planning to secure victory.</p>
